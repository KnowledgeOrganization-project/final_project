                        John Dryden is a prominent figure in English literature from the Seventeenth century, known for his work as a dramatist and literary critic. One of Dryden's criticisms of Shakespeare's work revolved around the concept of decorum and rational judgment, particularly in the context of the audience and the age in which Shakespeare wrote. Dryden believed the absence of decorum in Shakespeare's plays stemmed from their composition for an audience perceived by the critic as unenlightened and inadequately educated within the context of Shakespeare's contemporary milieu.
