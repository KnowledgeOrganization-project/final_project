                        John Dryden is a prominent figure in English literature from the Seventeenth century, known for his work as a dramatist and literary critic. One of Dryden's criticisms of Shakespeare's work revolved around the concept of decorum and rational judgment, particularly in the context of the audience and the age in which Shakespeare wrote. Dryden believed that Shakespeare's plays lacked decorum because they were written for what he perceived as an ignorant and poorly educated audience of Shakespeare's time.
